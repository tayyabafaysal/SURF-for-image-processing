# SURF-for-image-processing
# Overview
A desktop-application developed in OpenCV C# that automatically detects fracture by processing X-Ray Images. The trained model automatically detects vertebras by extracting features and match it with key points of source image and then fracture classification into three types from Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry images.

# Tools and Technologies

Programming Language that has been used for the development of this application is C# with OpenCV library, whereas the tool Used is Visual Studio
